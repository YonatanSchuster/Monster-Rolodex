# Monster Rolodex

The project is a monster rolodex that I created during my Udemy course in react.js `Complete React Developer in 2022 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)`

You can type any name of a monster and it will filter it to you 

To set up the project you need to:

1. run the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies 

2. Open the terminal and run the command `npm run start`

### After typing some letters at the search box, the monsters will filter to the monster that you searched
